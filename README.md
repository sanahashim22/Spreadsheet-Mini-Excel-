# Spreadsheet-Mini-Excel-
This is a simple, text-based spreadsheet application developed in C++ that mimics basic functionalities of Excel. The program allows users to create a dynamic grid of cells where they can navigate, input data, delete rows/columns, and perform basic file operations like loading and saving CSV files. The grid structure is maintained using a linked list, and cell data is represented as strings. It supports interactive features like inserting rows/columns, clearing cells, copying, cutting, and pasting data using the keyboard. Additionally, it includes color-coded cell borders for a better visual experience and offers mouse-based navigation for row/column selection.
